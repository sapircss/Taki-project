The cards are shuffled and each player receives eight. The rest of the deck becomes the draw pile. The top card in the draw pile is turned over and placed face up next to the draw pile to form a discard pile. The upper card of the discard pile is called the Leading Card. The youngest player goes first. Starting clockwise, each player discards a card (or cards) onto the leading card, by (a) matching its color; or (b) matching its number or figure; or (c) using a SuperTaki, Switch Color, or King card. A player who cannot play draws one card from the draw pile. It may be used only in the next round. A player who is left with one card in their hand must announce "Last card!". If they fail to do so before the next player made their move, they draw 4 cards from the draw pile. The game ends when the first player has discarded their last card.
